# Murray's Walkabout
My first Discord bot whose sole goal is to tear my family apart in the form of introducing competitive text-chat based gaming to our Discord server.

## What it is right now...
First and foremost this bot is a stupid reference to the character [Murray](https://slycooper.fandom.com/wiki/Murray) from the early 2000's "here for a good time, not a long time" PS2 Platforming series Sly Cooper. This character often serves as comic relief, endearingly referring to himself as "The Murray".
Right now it is a shallow repository of quotes that you can have your very own The Murray spew at you when mentioned, or when summoned by the currently static "_m" prefix

## what it is going to be...
the app is intended to deliver an in-channel competitive experience based on the extremely awesome [Worldle](https://worldle.teuteuf.fr) by [teuteuf](https://github.com/teuteuf), which brought my family together in a daily ritual quickly after we discovered it.
It doesn't do that right now, but hopefully it will soon.

## What does it mean to me?
Beyond my enthusiasm at making something my family and I can enjoy together directly, this is also my chance to write some JavaScript in a new capacity with truly the bare minimum dependencies.
