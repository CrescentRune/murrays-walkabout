# Murray's Walkabout
My first Discord bot whose sole goal is to tear my family apart in the form of introducing competitive text-chat based gaming to our Discord server.

## What it is right now...
First and foremost this bot is a stupid reference to the character [Murray](https://slycooper.fandom.com/wiki/Murray) from the early 2000's "here for a good time, not a long time" PS2 platforming series Sly Cooper. This character often serves as comic relief, endearingly referring to himself as "The Murray".

Right now it is a shallow repository of quotes that you can have your very own _The Murray_ spew at you when mentioned, or when summoned by the currently static "_m" prefix.

To do that, simply follow the Discord application/bot set-up, and add your own config.json file with a BOT_TOKEN from the one the web UI gives you. I recommend you add the bot with admin privileges, as it will attempt actions assuming that privilege level..

I'll add recommendations for application deployment and hosting once I know what exactly my own plans are for it. 
Especially since I foresee a huge market in the overlap of niche, 20-year-old, dead, video game franchise fans, and those who serially play Wordle-style games...

## What it is going to be...
The app is intended to deliver an in-channel competitive gaming experience based on the extremely awesome [Worldle](https://worldle.teuteuf.fr) by [teuteuf](https://github.com/teuteuf). The game brought my family together in a daily ritual after we discovered it.
My app doesn't do that right now, but hopefully it will soon.

## What does it mean to me?
Beyond my enthusiasm at making something my family and I can enjoy together directly, this is also my chance to write some JavaScript in a new capacity with truly the bare minimum dependencies.
